# Assisted Living Facility Data Analysis

This project is focused on analyzing data related to Assisted Living Facilities (ALFs) to assess various aspects such as care quality, staffing, and operational efficiency. The analysis uses two Jupyter notebooks: one for data cleaning and preprocessing, and the other for generating insights and scoring metrics.

## Project Structure

```
.
├── data/                   # Directory containing CSV files for analysis
├── cleaner.ipynb           # Notebook to preprocess and clean CSV data
├── main.ipynb              # Notebook for analysis and scoring metrics
├── README.md               # Project documentation
```

## Notebooks

### 1. `cleaner.ipynb`
- **Purpose:** 
  - This notebook is responsible for cleaning and preprocessing the CSV files located in the `data` folder. 
  - It handles missing data, standardizes columns, and ensures the dataset is in a format suitable for analysis.

### 2. `main.ipynb`
- **Purpose:**
  - This notebook performs the main analysis on the preprocessed data, focusing on key metrics for evaluating ALF operations and quality of care.
  - The notebook contains visualizations and scoring metrics to assess different aspects such as staffing ratios, resident satisfaction, and care quality.

## Data

The `data` folder contains the relevant CSV files needed for analysis, which are cleaned using the `cleaner.ipynb` notebook before analysis in the `main.ipynb` notebook. Make sure all necessary data files are stored in this folder before running the notebooks.
